          During my time at HUST I learned how big the world is, how ebb and flow of life is, how crazy of youth is and how to love and be loved.

          I spent a lot of my free time as an member of the *Bach Khoa voluntary blood donation Team* taking on roles as *Captain*. Moreover, I also take part in activity that help new student to find motel.
          And I can't forget the green terraced fields when I went to remote areas to help ethnic minorities.
